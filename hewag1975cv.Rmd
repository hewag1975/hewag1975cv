# About me

My name is Hendrik Wagenseil, I am 47 years old and live in the city of 
Nuremberg (Bavaria) close to the Frankenjura. I love all kinds of outdoor 
activities, whereas my absolute favorites are rock climbing, biking, running and 
(ski) mountaineering. I also enjoy introducing my three kids Christoph, Johannes 
and Annika to these activities and volunteer as a climbing and mountaineering 
instructor for the German Alpine Club since 1996. Me, my wife and my kids enjoy 
traveling and exploring new places as a family and have been to Sweden, Greece, 
France and many other countries. This summer, Iceland is our destination.  

&nbsp;

Besides that, I am a passionate data scientist. Being geographer by education, 
creating insights from spatial data is my favorite research activity. I have 
been extensively working with R and all sorts of associated (spatial) packages 
for data wrangling, data visualization and modeling / machine learning (e.g. 
data.table, sf, stars, ggplot2, mapview, ranger, caret, etc.). I am keen on 
exploring new methods and using them to generate understandable and actionable 
insights from data. Since two years I have been exclusively working on Ubuntu and 
meanwhile am a big fan of it.

&nbsp;

Like most Data Scientists I sometimes use my spare time for coding. The little 
Shiny application "cdcexplorer" ([URL](https://hewag1975.shinyapps.io/cdcexplorer/)) is 
an example that I invite you to visit (note that it is hosted on a free web 
server and may take some time to launch). Code is freely available on my 
GitHub repo.

&nbsp;

I am fluent in English, spreche Deutsch als Muttersprache y puedo hablar un 
poco de EspaÃ±ol.
