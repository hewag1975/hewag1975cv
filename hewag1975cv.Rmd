# About me

My name is Hendrik Wagenseil, I am 47 years old and live in the city of 
Nuremberg. I love all kinds of outdoor activities, whereas my absolute favorites 
are rock climbing, biking, running and (ski) mountaineering. I also enjoy 
introducing my three kids Christoph, Johannes and Annika to these activities 
and volunteer as a climbing and mountaineering instructor for the German Alpine 
Club since 1996. Me, my wife and my kids enjoy traveling and exploring new 
places as a family and have been to Sweden, Greece, France and many other 
countries.\

Professionally I am a passionate data scientist. Being geographer by education, 
processing and creating insights from spatial data is my favorite research 
activity. I also have developed machine learning models in various contexts 
(predicting consumer behavior, modeling sales performance), worked with 
physical models on plant growth and time series data and also created multiple 
interactive applications to create insights from data for non-expert users.\

Language-wise have been extensively working with R and all sorts of associated 
(spatial) packages for data wrangling, data visualization and modeling / 
machine learning (e.g. data.table, sf, stars, ggplot2, mapview, ranger, caret, 
shiny, etc.). I am keen on exploring new methods and using them to generate 
understandable and actionable insights from data. Since two years I have been 
exclusively working on Ubuntu and meanwhile am a big fan of it.\

Like most Data Scientists I sometimes use my spare time for coding. The little 
Shiny application "cdcexplorer" 
([URL](https://hewag1975.shinyapps.io/cdcexplorer/)) is an example that I 
invite you to visit (note that it takes a moment to launch it). Code is 
available on my GitHub repo.\

I am fluent in English, spreche Deutsch als Muttersprache y puedo hablar un poco 
de EspaÃ±ol.
